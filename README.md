# ownHome
Deploy modular bashrc, vimrc and others.  
  
  
To install:  
`git clone https://github.com/pgum/ownHome ~/.ownHome && ~/.ownHome/auto.deployEnv && $SHELL`  
  
  
Have fun :)

# TODO
* Separate deployment scripts from dotfiles
* Create update system
* Give more informations when deployEnv
* Create better installer scripts - use `make` maybe? 
* constantly add new things
