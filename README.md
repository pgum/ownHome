##Nowhere better then ~/
This repository consist of dot files for my linux machines. There are some few useful bits here and there.
I try to make it easy to understand and modify. I also want to easy update my configs, so I wrote few scripts for that.

  
To install:  
`git clone https://github.com/pgum/ownHome ~/.ownHome && ~/.ownHome/auto.deployEnv && $SHELL`  
  
  
Have fun :)
